Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

This image represents the relationships between a host, environment, and a pathogen. This model is useful in understanding disease transmission and how to control outbreaks by targeting one or more of the components.

1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%
59

2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population
A would be 298
B would be 228

3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is _____ (<, =, >) ____%
Less than 1%

4) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and Russell counties).
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.
b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test
A) Chambers: 13.1-44.9%
  Russel: 0.9-8.7%
  Lee: 14.3-27.3%
B) Chambers: 26.7%
  Russell: 3.1%
  Lee: 20%

5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:
Day 1: 3 fish infected
Day 2: 4 fish infected
Day 3: 7 fish infected
Day 4: 11 fish infected
Day 5: 20 fish infected
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish in the pond (including previously infected fish).
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.
b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?
A) Day 1 is 3, day 2 is 1, and day 5 is 9
B) PSD on day 3 = 11.7%, day 5 = 33.33%
C) there is no day where the prevalence is the same as the incidence

Disease models are a useful tool among the wildlife management community. There is an array of uses to disease models and as stated in the Starfield article it can map out years of change in a few hours. Disease models help wildlife managers understand diseases spread and anticipate future outbreaks. These models help contribute to better management strategies by predicting disease spread, give a risk free space to see how a disease could affect your herd, and they incorporate many other human interferences and how they may effect your animals. While there are many good uses for models such as these, sometimes they fall short. Data uncertainty is a challenge among wildlife managers since certain data can be hard to gather like population size or disease prevalence. If the model is used with poor data it can cause data skewing or make the data unusable. We also have to take into account the complexity of the real world. There is no way to leave room for predator interactions within a population or interspecies disease transmissions. Not only should we be using models but also look at a collaborative approach. By taking in more knowledge from someone else, you can fill in gaps in the data. We can also do more field work to see how these animals interact with their environment giving us more useful data for models. In Starfield they use several models for buffalo populations to see how different population sizes fair. Take model 2 for example, they use models to see how a herd of buffalo will do after 50 or 100 years. The article talks about how the population crashes and grows constantly. By using this data they are able to tell if buffalo culling is necessary or not. In a later example there are wolf cubs, and we have to weigh the costs against probability of success. They used a model that helped stakeholders make sensible decisions for this population. Simple modeling can help tremendously through the long run. With this type of modeling we can assess the consequences or benefits without messing with a population. While disease models are invaluable for wildlife disease management, they are most effective when used alongside other tools and within an adaptive management framework. Recognizing their limitations allows managers to use models in a realistic way. Ultimately, disease models, when combined with robust data collection and a flexible management approach, can significantly improve the outcomes of wildlife disease management strategies.
