Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

This image represents the relationships between a host, environment, and a pathogen. This model is useful in understanding disease transmission and how to control outbreaks by targeting one or more of the components.

Worksheet 2 & 3

1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%
59

2) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population
b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population
A would be 298
B would be 228

3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is _____ (<, =, >) ____%
Less than 1%

4) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and Russell counties).
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.
b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test
A) Chambers: 13.1-44.9%
  Russel: 0.9-8.7%
  Lee: 14.3-27.3%
B) Chambers: 26.7%
  Russell: 3.1%
  Lee: 20%

5) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:
Day 1: 3 fish infected
Day 2: 4 fish infected
Day 3: 7 fish infected
Day 4: 11 fish infected
Day 5: 20 fish infected
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish in the pond (including previously infected fish).
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.
b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?
A) Day 1 is 3, day 2 is 1, and day 5 is 9
B) PSD on day 3 = 11.7%, day 5 = 33.33%
C) there is no day where the prevalence is the same as the incidence

Disease models are a useful tool among the wildlife management community. There is an array of uses to disease models and as stated in the Starfield article it can map out years of change in a few hours. Disease models help wildlife managers understand diseases spread and anticipate future outbreaks. These models help contribute to better management strategies by predicting disease spread, give a risk free space to see how a disease could affect your herd, and they incorporate many other human interferences and how they may effect your animals. While there are many good uses for models such as these, sometimes they fall short. Data uncertainty is a challenge among wildlife managers since certain data can be hard to gather like population size or disease prevalence. If the model is used with poor data it can cause data skewing or make the data unusable. We also have to take into account the complexity of the real world. There is no way to leave room for predator interactions within a population or interspecies disease transmissions. Not only should we be using models but also look at a collaborative approach. By taking in more knowledge from someone else, you can fill in gaps in the data. We can also do more field work to see how these animals interact with their environment giving us more useful data for models. In Starfield they use several models for buffalo populations to see how different population sizes fair. Take model 2 for example, they use models to see how a herd of buffalo will do after 50 or 100 years. The article talks about how the population crashes and grows constantly. By using this data they are able to tell if buffalo culling is necessary or not. In a later example there are wolf cubs, and we have to weigh the costs against probability of success. They used a model that helped stakeholders make sensible decisions for this population. Simple modeling can help tremendously through the long run. With this type of modeling we can assess the consequences or benefits without messing with a population. While disease models are invaluable for wildlife disease management, they are most effective when used alongside other tools and within an adaptive management framework. Recognizing their limitations allows managers to use models in a realistic way. Ultimately, disease models, when combined with robust data collection and a flexible management approach, can significantly improve the outcomes of wildlife disease management strategies.

The fecal flotation lab was extremely educational. The woman running the lab experiment was very knowledgeable about the entire process and even found a few parasite eggs on the fecal slide. We were able to get a hands-on experience and were walked through the procedure if we needed help. The hardest part about this lab was collecting a sample from our fecal solution after we spun it, the speed in which it must be collected is a bit nerve wracking since you don’t want the solution to settle to the point where you collect no eggs, if there are any. Once the fecal collection was done, we put it on a slide and looked at it under a microscope. Getting to see what the eggs looked like was fascinating since we thought the air bubbles were eggs at first.  All in all, this lab was interesting and I am glad we got to do it.

The Marburg virus outbreak could be classified as both a spillover event and an emerging infectious disease. It is a spillover event since the pathogen originated Egyptian rousette bats and has moved over to humans, a case of zoonotic spillover. It can also be classified as en emerging infectious disease since it has spread to 65 people and could continue to spread to care providers who are trying to treat patients. Ways we can reduce transmission in community settings is limiting contact with infected individuals. We can also reduce transmission in healthcare settings by the use of PPE and regular health checks on healthcare workers to detect symptoms early so we can quarantine them.

Worksheet 7,8,9

106 raccoons were necropsied and the findings are split between male/female, age, and region. The findings were 37 females / 69 males, 69 adults / 37 young adults, 49 North / 43 South / 14 Central. The overall prevalence in the population was ~47.2% of raccoons were infected with parasites. Comparing the regions and their prevalence the South had the highest with 25.5% infected raccoons while the North had 13.2% and Central came in at 8.5%. Out of Males and Females, Males totaled a prevalence of 24.5% infected raccoons whereas Females had 22.6%. The prevalence for each of these was calculated by taking the number of infected and dividing it by the total population (106). 

Throughout this raccoon population there are a total 470 worms and over half of them reside within the female minority. While females have a larger worm count, males have the higher prevalence. This could mean males encounter more contaminated locations causing infection rates to climb. Looking into regions the South has the highest prevalence of infection meaning these worms are widespread throughout the area. Some patterns that can be observed are the South and its favorable conditions for these worms to thrive and how males may have biological differences which lead them to have a higher exposure rate.
